# Infills

What infills I use.

TD;LR I use gyroids: infill with increased strength for the lowest weight.



In the latest version of Cura (4.5), there are 13 types of infill available for use. We’ve grouped them according to what they’re best suited for:
| Features | Infills | Density |
|---|---|---|
|   Models and figurines (low strength) | Lines, zig-zag | 0 -> 15% |
|    “Standard” 3D prints (medium strength) | Grid, triangles, tri-hexagon | 15 -> 50% |
|    Functional 3D prints (high strength) | Cubic, cubic subdivision, octet, quarter cubic, gyroid | > 50% |
|    Flexible 3D prints | Concentric, cross, cross 3D | 0 -> 100% |

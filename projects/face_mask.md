This page describes only the cutting part, not the sewing part. There are many tutorials on the web about sewing a face mask.

For the pattern and instructions we had, we cut 20x20cm squares.
- pure cotton works fine. Make sure your fabric does not contain chlorine.
- It's (way) easier if the width of the fabric is at most the width of the machine (100 cm). If your fabric is larger, consider folding it and cutting several layers at once.
- tested settings on the Trotec: power 100, speed 8, frequency 5000. When cutting two sheets at the same time, halve the speed (ie speed 4).
- double check the fabric will not get in the path of the laser (between the right side of the plate and the moving red lense). Also be carful the moving arm will not touch and move the fabric.
- a thin sheet of fabric might hang out of the machine and will not prevent to close the lid.
- wrinkles are OK as long as they are not more than about 5mm high. Ironing the cloth beforehands helps.
- we had a 140cm wide cloth, which means an odd number of squares per line. Thus, when the fabric is folded, we cut half a square on the folded border. This is slightly less precise.

Productivity: once everything is setup, around 2h for ~500 pieces.
